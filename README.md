# FinTech Application to Modernize Drug Recalls, Prescription Changes and Over-The-Counter (OTC) Medicines for Consumers

### Background

Legal drugs and medicines can prove just as dangerous as those on the street. **Unfortunately, the FDA is not required to publicly recall products** (Laguna 2022).Every year, there are thousands of recalls issued by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA).  A drug recall occurs when a prescription or over-the-counter medicine is removed from the market because it is found to be either defective or potentially harmful. Sometimes, the makers of the drug will discover a problem with their drug and voluntarily recall it.

Other times, the FDA will request that the medicine be recalled after receiving reports of problems from the public (WebMD 2022). Once on the market, the FDA, along with the makers of prescription drugs, continue to monitor the medicine for any unforeseen problems (WebMD 2022). Unfortunately, recalls and changes to prescription drugs are often `untimely` and `costly` to the consumer which may result in financial implications or death. Adverse effects lead to approximately 700,000 emergency room visits each year.

Prescription drugs have become an increasingly important part of U.S. health care, as evidenced by the growth in nationwide spending on those drugs from 1980 to 2018 (Congressional Budget Office 2022).  Over this period, such spending increased more than tenfold in real terms (that is, with the effects of economywide inflation excluded). 

Today as Baby Boomers continue to leave the American workforce, millions of people are now faced with the high cost of medical care and prescription drugs on a fixed income. There have already been many accounts where many Americans have been forced into a decision to either replenish their medical prescriptions or pay their household bills. Millions of dollars are wasted with changes caused by recalls and prescription drug changes. Opportunities exist to improve:

* `Insurance claims` that take months to resolve and process 
* `Physicians` not being aware of recalls and the need for prescription changes
* `Location` and availability of newly prescribed drug to consumers

The rising costs of prescription drugs and the logistical management of drug recalls impacts many industries across America.

Consumersâ€™ use of prescription drugs has increased over time. Today, approximately 82% of Americans take at least one prescription drug.
